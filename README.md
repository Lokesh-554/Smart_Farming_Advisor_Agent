# 🌾 AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice

A capstone project under the IBM internship, this AI-powered agent delivers **localized, real-time agricultural advice** to small-scale farmers using **IBM Granite LLMs** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Small farmers often lack timely and localized agricultural information.

This project solves that by enabling farmers to ask queries like:

- *"What crop should I plant this season?"*
- *"What is today’s mandi rate for tomatoes?"*

The AI retrieves answers from reliable data sources such as government portals, weather APIs, and agricultural databases.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

- Develop an AI assistant using **IBM Granite-3-3-8-b-instruct** model.
- Interact in regional languages (Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada).
- Provide real-time information on:
  - Crop recommendations
  - Market prices (mandi)
  - Weather forecasts
  - Pest management
  - Soil health

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **IBM Cloud Lite**
- **IBM Watsonx.ai**
- **Granite-3-3-8-b-instruct (LLM)**
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **OpenWeatherMap API**
- **Agmarknet**
- **Python / Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Git / GitHub**

---

## 🧠 Model & Deployment

- Uses **vectorized agricultural data** for semantic search via RAG.
- Multilingual support using prompt engineering.
- Deployed using **IBM Watsonx** deployment space with preview link.
- Secured via API keys and tested in Watsonx Studio.

---

## ✅ Results

### 🧪 Sample Queries and Responses

- **Q**: “What crop should I plant in Kharif in Karnataka with red sandy soil?”  
  **A**: “Millets and groundnut are recommended due to low water needs and better yield in red sandy soil.”

- **Q**: “आज गुंटूर में टमाटर का मुंडी भाव क्या है?”  
  **A**: “आज गुंटूर में टमाटर का औसत मुंडी भाव ₹1450 प्रति टन है।”

### 🔍 Key Highlights

- Live, real-time responses
- Multilingual support
- Context-aware answer generation
- API-integrated and farmer-friendly

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integrate with **IoT sensors** for real-time soil/weather conditions
- Add **offline-first mobile app** support for remote users
- Extend **predictive analytics** for crop yields and pests
- Connect with **government schemes and insurance APIs**
